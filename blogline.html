            <hr>
            <p>Because the bulk of our work is confidential, it’s hard (and illegal) to showcase the range of actual projects we’ve worked on. The aim of this bloglike section is to demonstrate the <strong>power of clear writing</strong> to compress complex source material into actionable, readable documents.</p>
            <p>Predictably, we agonized over how to seed this section with exemplary writing, but in the end we settled on making this a space for exploration. </p>
            <p>We want to write good things for their intrinsic value.</p>

          <h1>Hacking in Python</h1>
          <hr>
          <h2>Syntax Highlighting</h2>
          <p>We use <a href="https://highlightjs.org/">highlightjs</a> for syntax highlighting. It&#39;s very simple to use (it took an objectively stupid man less than 10 minutes to set it up and configure to our needs).</p>
          <h2 id="first-step">First step</h2>
<hr>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/leemthompo/screen-shot/commit/817a63500e761b14eda82189d4c16f685db1759a#diff-9f3aebda57f61762a48f982cf40286c31e36a1c6f480d98634102bf03e26a032">script</a> at this GitHub commit is a command-line tool written in Python, where we pass the name of the HTML file (generated by Screenotate <a href="https://screenotate.com/">the underlying OCR program</a>). The Python script uses Beautiful Soup to parse the tags, a simple regex to remove the HTML tags, and then copies the relevant text to the clipboard.</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-meta">#!/usr/bin/env python3</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> sys
<span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> re
<span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> pyperclip
from bs4 <span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> BeautifulSoup
</code></pre>
<h2 id="prerequisites-shebangs-imports">Prerequisites: Shebangs &amp; Imports</h2>
<hr>

<p>The script is executed from the command-line, so the first line is a shebang.</p>
<p>The script has 4 import statements:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>sys</code> allows us to take arguments from the command line</li>
<li><code>re</code> provides regular expression matching operations</li>
<li><code>pyperclip</code> provides copy and paste clipboard functions</li>
<li><code>Beautiful Soup</code> allows us to parse HTML files</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="program-flow">Program Flow</h2>
<hr>

<ol>
<li><p>The user passes the name of the HTML file generated by Screenotate, which is then stored in the <code>user_file</code> variable. </p>
</li>
<li><p>The file is then run through Beautiful Soup, creating a <code>BeautifulSoup object</code> (where the document is represented as a nested data structure.) The <code>find_all(&quot;pre&quot;)</code> method finds the relevant text for the user. (Screenotate uses <code>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</code> tags to enclose the OCR&#39;d text).</p>
</li>
<li><p>We use a simple regex to find the <code>pre</code> tags, so they can be removed. We don&#39;t want them in our output text.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Per the exhaustive docstring, the <code>remove_tags()</code> function removes the tags from the file generated by the OCR app, strips line breaks and copies the relevant text to the clipboard</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-title">remove_tags</span><span class="hljs-params">(text)</span>:</span>
 notags = tags.sub(<span class="hljs-string">""</span>, text)  <span class="hljs-comment"># Strip tags</span>
 without_line_breaks = notags.replace(<span class="hljs-string">"\n"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">" "</span>)  <span class="hljs-comment"># Strip line breaks</span>
 pyperclip.copy(without_line_breaks)  <span class="hljs-comment"># Copy text to clipboard</span>
 print(<span class="hljs-string">"Parsed text copied to clipboard!"</span>)
 <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> without_line_breaks
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>We call the function on the stringified text parsed by Beautiful Soup </p>
</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="introducing-draft-number-zero">Introducing Draft Number Zero</h1>
<hr>
<h2 id="first-draft-minus-one">First draft minus one</h2>
<p>Ghost-writing is at best inferior and at worst dishonest. We help you navigate between the Scylla of the blank page and the Charybdis of plagiarism, by accelerating the quantum leap from notes to first draft.</p>
<h2 id="ghost-written-zeroth-drafts">Ghost-written zeroth drafts</h2>
<p>You have an essay, story or report that you want to write but you just can&#39;t get the wheels turning. We provide the catalyst for your writing process. You send us a title, theme and headings and we&#39;ll produce a pre-first draft or <strong>zeroth draft</strong>.  </p>
<p>The title, theme and headings are codified in a basic data structure. This becomes the scaffolding for your original, bona fide first draft.</p>
<h2 id="more-is-different">More is different</h2>
<p>You get to benefit from cognitive diversity by feeding your seed ideas into a different brain and outsourcing the most problematic step in any writing process. This catalyst helps accelerate the onset of <em>finishing fever</em> — the essential condition for project completion.  </p>
<p>We help you tease out the salient aspects of your hitherto indefinite idea space, branching your network of ideas off into uncharted territory. Importantly, the majority of these branches will be dead ends and part of your work will be to edit or prune this bloated decision tree.  </p>
<p>You can think of this service as something like a GPT-3 transformer prompt, but powered by real human intelligence.</p>
<h3 id="how-it-works">How it works</h3>
<p>You provide the opening sentence, if possible a <em>logline</em> (one line nutshell of the piece), a network of ideas, the essential keywords and the required tone.  </p>
<p>You work in <strong>Markdown</strong>, a lightweight markup language with <strong>plain-text-formatting syntax</strong>. Use headings by typing # for Title Heading, ## for sub-headings and ### for next-subheading etc. Markdown makes everything simple.  </p>
<p>We take this skeleton and chart a simple (but opinionated) path through the idea tree. Expect pleasing sentences, provocative analogies and high-variance logical trajectories.  </p>
<p>Instead of being the harried junior reporter rushing to meet his first draft deadline, you  play the senior editor — legs akimbo on your desktop, attacking the first working draft with paternal skepticism and a red marker.</p>
<h2 id="nothing-more-nothing-less">Nothing more, nothing less</h2>
<p>This is not plagiarism in disguise or marketing style ghost-written documents. We explicitly produce only a rough, unkempt pre-first draft. Importantly, we don&#39;t write a true first draft. We merely expedite the process to speed up the phase transition between rough notes and a first draft. The rest is up to you.</p>
<h2 id="via-negativa">Via Negativa</h2>
<p>It&#39;s far easier to criticize than to create.  We help you sidestep writer&#39;s block by submitting a plausible <strong>zeroth draft</strong> which, on average, you can <em>expect to dislike</em>. By correcting the things you dislike and boosting the signal of the things you like, that clamlike draft will emerge from its protective shell.     </p>
<p>We turn your raw block of ideas into a fat, underwrought sculpture which contains the seeds of manifold forms. You can then attack this rough shape and sculpt it into an original, coherent document.</p>
<h2 id="foul-rarr-fair">Foul &rarr; Fair</h2>
<p>This is the spark for you to correct our third-party sins against logic and rhetoric. Before you know it you have cut out the rotten wood, rewired the faulty logic and your true first draft has emerged.    </p>
<p>Our last step is your first step. You can now begin the journey of true creativity.</p>

<h2 id="step-1-what-kind-of-documentation-do-you-need-">Step 1: What kind of documentation do you need?</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Business docs</strong> (meeting minutes, debate summary, financial reports...)</li>
<br/>
<li><strong>Software docs</strong> (API docs, man pages, user guides...)</li>
<br/>
<li><strong>Scientific docs</strong> (team meeting summaries, process documentation, conference summaries...)</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="step-2-do-you-need-your-writer-to-attend-a-live-session-">Step 2: Do you need your writer to attend a live session?</h2>
<p>Ideally, we can work asynchronously to avoid any scheduling complications. This also helps keep project costs down, because live sessions are more expensive. </p>
<p>Now that most meetings and events are taking place using videoconferencing tools, it&#39;s even easier to work asynchronously. You just send us the recorded video, where each speaker is identified automatically. This reduces the friction of working on new projects and helps avoid attribution errors, especially for conferences and Q&amp;A sessions.</p>
<h2 id="step-3-all-about-deadlines">Step 3: All about deadlines</h2>
<p>Deadlines are the lifeblood of a writer&#39;s routine. We have a usual delivery time of <strong>7 working days</strong> for our standard documents. If you need a rapid turnaround, when possible, this will come extra. As a small team, we have a natural project load which means that super quick turnarounds are the exception, rather than the rule.</p>
<h2 id="step-4-fine-tuning">Step 4: Fine tuning</h2>
<p>We like to keep the lines of dialogue open during the writing process. We are available for any adjustments, addenda or reshaping that you might want to make. We are more than happy to jump on a quick video call or iterate via email for any fine tuning. </p>
<h2 id="step-5-delivery-and-payment">Step 5: Delivery and payment</h2>
<p>We use a simple Stripe checkout to bill per project. You will receive a notification (via email) that your document is ready, with the link to the secure payment page. You will receive your documents once the payment is complete. </p>

    <h1 id="the-english-language-as-a-service">The English language as a service</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This is the first in a series of logline mission outlines. The bulk of global business documentation and communications are in the English language. English use is accelerating worldwide, because it is the de facto <em>lingua franca</em> of science and technology. We believe that clear and compelling written communication is a bottleneck for non-native English speaking teams, founders and scientists.</p>
<h2 id="the-english-language-as-substrate">The English language as substrate</h2>
<p>The world is witnessing exponential growth in technology startups, scientific knowledge and global inter-disciplinary cooperative projects. The entire substrate of basic research and the programming languages that power the modern world is built on top of the English language. </p>
<p>This means that first rate English language skills are a prerequisite today for teams operating in the fields of business, science and technology. Take the example of ITER, an international nuclear fusion research and engineering megaproject, funded and run by seven member entities—the European Union, India, Japan, China, Russia, South Korea and the United States. The official language of ITER Organization is English. At the end of the day everything gets compiled into English.</p>
<h2 id="more-globalization-means-more-english">More globalization means more English</h2>
<p>As the whole world moves online, led by startups, we are seeing a new wave of globalization, further compounding the importance of excellent English communications. This raises the bar for everybody and, in particular, smaller teams. For any team looking to sell a product or service worldwide, imperfect English copy is a severe handicap.</p>
<h2 id="full-stack-english-engineers">Full-stack English engineers</h2>
<p>We help teams of all shapes and sizes outline, draft and complete essential documentation in English. The bulk of our work involves summarising mission-critical meetings, developing a memo system and producing pristine, readable papers for your audience. </p>
<p>We believe in systems thinking and we look at your natural language expression throughout your activity — from your idea generation and internal memo writing, to your official documentation, marketing copy and external papers. We are full-stack English engineers!</p>

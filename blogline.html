            <hr>
            <p>Because the bulk of our work is confidential, it’s hard (and illegal) to showcase the range of actual projects we’ve worked on. The aim of this bloglike section is to demonstrate the <strong>power of clear writing</strong> to compress complex source material into actionable, readable documents.</p>
            <p>Predictably, we agonized over how to seed this section with exemplary writing, but in the end we settled on making this a space for exploration. </p>
            <p>We want to write good things for their intrinsic value.</p>

      <h1 id="why-hire-a-professional-writer-">Why hire a professional writer?</h1>
      <hr>
      <p>If you and your team have limited bandwidth (namely time) to devote to drafting memos, summaries or other key docs, it’s best to outsource this work. Having an experienced writer who focuses entirely on the project at hand inevitably leads to better results.</p>
      <p>Equally important is the quality of the writing. If you don’t have the fluency or experience (perhaps you’re a non-native English speaker), then it’s critical to delegate the drafting of important docs.</p>
     <p>There can be important legal and reputational risks to producing substandard documentation. For example, in the API economy software documentation is customer-facing copy. If a small startup in Paris has a killer app, but the docs and man pages are written in Frenglish, this is going to hurt them on the international market.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This is the first in a series of logline mission outlines. The bulk of global business documentation and communications are in the English language. English use is accelerating worldwide, because it is the de facto <em>lingua franca</em> of science and technology. We believe that clear and compelling written communication is a bottleneck for non-native English speaking teams, founders and scientists.</p>
<h2 id="the-english-language-as-substrate">The English language as substrate</h2>
<p>The world is witnessing exponential growth in technology startups, scientific knowledge and global inter-disciplinary cooperative projects. The entire substrate of basic research and the programming languages that power the modern world is built on top of the English language. </p>
<p>This means that first rate English language skills are a prerequisite today for teams operating in the fields of business, science and technology. Take the example of ITER, an international nuclear fusion research and engineering megaproject, funded and run by seven member entities—the European Union, India, Japan, China, Russia, South Korea and the United States. The official language of ITER Organization is English. At the end of the day everything gets compiled into English.</p>
<h2 id="more-globalization-means-more-english">More globalization means more English</h2>
<p>As the whole world moves online, led by startups, we are seeing a new wave of globalization, further compounding the importance of excellent English communications. This raises the bar for everybody and, in particular, smaller teams. For any team looking to sell a product or service worldwide, imperfect English copy is a severe handicap.</p>
<h2 id="full-stack-english-engineers">Full-stack English engineers</h2>
<p>We help teams of all shapes and sizes outline, draft and complete essential documentation in English. The bulk of our work involves summarising mission-critical meetings, developing a memo system and producing pristine, readable papers for your audience. </p>
<p>We believe in systems thinking and we look at your natural language expression throughout your activity — from your idea generation and internal memo writing, to your official documentation, marketing copy and external papers. We are full-stack English engineers!</p>

    <h1 id="finishing-fever">Finishing Fever</h1>
    <hr>

<p><strong>The fundamental bottleneck is the human animal as it is, and not as we wish it were.</strong> — Richard Hamming</p>
<h2 id="zero-to-one">Zero To One</h2>
    <hr>
<p>The goal of any writing project is to accelerate the onset of <strong>finishing fever</strong> — the essential condition for project completion. Finishing fever means getting far enough down the line that it would be harder to <em>not</em> finish the project.</p>
<h2 id="write-a-lead">Write a Lead</h2>
    <hr>
<p>The essence of good writing is focus. Your piece should have a <strong>logline</strong> — the nutshell summary or elevator pitch — and the scope of the piece should be 90% defined. The extra 10% is wiggle room for creativity.</p>
<p>Your notes are in place, you&#39;ve turned the ideas around in your mind for days. Stop. Write an opening sentence. John McPhee said it best: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The lead — like the title — should be a flashlight that shines down into the story. A lead is a promise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You&#39;ve made a promise to the reader. Keeping that promise is your North Star. </p>
<p>Later, as you edit your drafts, your editorial algorithm is simple: <strong>Am I keeping my promise?</strong></p>
<h2 id="the-pareto-principle">The Pareto Principle</h2>
    <hr>
<p>For McPhee, the first draft takes four times as long as the rest of the work combined. This power law is invariant to the scale of the project:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That four-to-one ratio in writing time—first draft versus the other drafts combined—has for me been consistent in projects of any length, even if the first draft takes only a few days or weeks.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-phase-transition">The Phase Transition</h2>
    <hr>
<p>When the first draft is complete, the project undergoes a phase transition. The panic subsides and you shift from writer to editor. </p>
<p>Prepare for finishing fever.</p>
